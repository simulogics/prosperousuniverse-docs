Hello. Welcome back to APEX, and thank you for choosing the comprehensive Constructor Profession set up guide.

As mentioned when you picked the constructor profession, Constructors are very good at mixing and matching to meet the various demands for the galaxy, as their factory choices can take a multitude of inputs to produce a profit.

To start lets click the construct command in the base tile. From here, you will see you have the infrastructure tab selected, it’s here that you can find a catalog of habitation units that are available for you to build. Since our starter workforce will largely contain pioneers, lets build two pioneer habitation units. After that, lets navigate to the Pioneers tab of the construction tile. It’s here that you can see the Basic Materials Plant, and the Prefab Plant Mark 1. If you notice, they have a workforce requirement. In this case, the Basic Materials Plant  will require 100 pioneers, and the Prefab Plant Mark 1 will require 80 pioneers. Since you have been given enough construction materials for 2 pioneer habitation units you have room on your base for 200 pioneers. Let's build the basic materials plant and the prefab plant mark 1.

Next, lets once again adjust the UI by expanding the bottom right two windows vertically a bit. Inside the upper blank tile, we are going to put your production information in there, so please navigate to your bases tile and select production. With the Tile that just appeared, please drag it into the blank tile.

Next, we also want to find out about the resources your workforce will consume to produce your goods, so select the workforce button in the base tile, and drag it to the bottommost blank tile.

You will now see in the production tile that you have two production lines. Please select the NEW ORDER button above the Basic Materials Plant. You will see that a production order tile appeared. It is here that you can order production on a variety of recipes, so in this case as an example, lets select from the production template the Mineral Construction Granulate recipe. As you can see, it requires 4 units of limestone, and 2 units of silicon ore. Next, you are going to see your order size slider. This increases the order size you wish to produce, but keep in mind it does not provide any other efficiency bonus apart from increasing the order size. So it is recommended to keep it at its lowest setting. Once you are satisfied with your order, click the queue order button.

Next, in your inventory you see that you also have 5 units of iron. Let's fire up the Prefab Plant Mark 1. You will have two recipes to select from, either the Basic Structural Element recipe, or the Basic Bulkhead recipe. Both are required for the construction of various buildings around the galaxy, so it is up to you what you want to produce, it might be a good idea to see what’s demanded on the market more, and use that as a guide to your decision. Once you have made your decision, click the Queue Order button.

Keep in mind that you can order multiple orders by clicking the Queue Order button again. It’s important to keep on top of your orders to ensure your factories are constantly producing.
Now that your plants are running, it’s best to wait until you get a sizable amount of Mineral Construction Granulate and Basic Prefabs. When you feel like your have enough, you will take it to the market to sell. Once you have sold your first batch of goods, it is recommended that you purchase more limestone, iron, and silicon ore to continue your production.

This has been the Comprehensive Constructor Profession set up guide, and has been indicated as complete by the APEX module, so this video broadcast will now be concluded. Please continue further to the next video broadcast about next steps with your base. Thank you for choosing the Advanced System for the Facilitation of Production and Exchange for the Exodus of Mankind.
