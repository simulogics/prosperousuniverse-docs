This is a comprehensive list of all commands available to you in APEX. They are grouped together by their respective areas of use. Understanding this list requires that you already be familiar with [how commands work](../../tutorials/commands). You may read through the whole list to gain an overview or use it as a reference to look up specific commands.

## Base commands

__BS__  
_Optional parameter: base ID_  
By itself shows an overview over all your bases. Shows more info on a concrete base when followed by a base ID, e.g. by clicking “View Base” in the generic BS window. Provides access to most other base-related commands.

__BSC__  
_Mandatory parameter: planet ID_  
Allows to create a new base on a planet. It shows necessary building materials and allows to select a plot on the surface. 

__BSL__  
_Mandatory parameter: base ID_  
Opens an overview over the buildings in a concrete base. Accessible via the BUILDINGS (formerly “SECTIONS”) button in a concrete BS window. Click “DEMOLISH” to destroy a Section, which will refund some of the resources that went into its construction, depending on its age. The possible refunded materials are listed as “Reclaimable materials”.

__BSC__  
_Mandatory parameter: base ID_  
Opens the Construct window of a concrete base. Accessible via the “Construct” button in a concrete BS window. Use the tabs at the top to cycle through different building categories. The line labeled “Area” indicates a building's area cost and, after the slash, the area left available in your base. The line labeled Workforce” shows the number and type of workforce required to operate this building.

__BUI__  
_Mandatory parameter: building ticker_  
Displays information on a building type: which kind of worker is employed here, how much space the building takes up and which parts go into its construction. Accessible by clicking a building type in the BSC window.

__INV__  
_Optional parameter: address or store ID_  
If no parameters are supplied the command will show a list of all your inventories, including base storage, cargo holds, fuel tanks and warehouse storage units. Clicking on the "open" button will show the contents of the selected inventory. In the top left, you will find several sorting options (AMT: amount, WGT: weight, VOL: volume) as well as a symbol to their left. Click it to toggle between list and grid mode; the latter shows more information on each commodity, such as their weight, volume, and book value.

If the parameter contains a system or planet address (for example `INV XK-745` or `INV XK-745a`) it will only show inventories at that location.

__MTRA__  
_Optional parameter: material ticker_  
_Optional parameter: source store ID_  
_Optional parameter: target store ID_  
Allows you to transfer a specific amount of items between two inventories. The material to be transferred as well as the source and target stores can be specified via the command's parameters or chosen from drop-down menus in the command window itself. Note that this command is also accessible (with pre-filled transfer details) via dragging an item from the source store to the target store and dropping it on the “AMT” slot.

__WF__  
_Mandatory parameter: base ID_  
Shows an overview over a base’s workforce and their needs. The more sophisticated the workforce tier, the higher their needs. If you can’t supply your workers with the consumables they need, the efficiency of buildings they operate will drop. Accessible via the “Workforce” button in a concrete BS window.

__EXP__  
_Mandatory parameter: base ID_  
Lists all fields which can receive bonuses by Experts and shows which Experts are currently being used in the specified base. Hit “REMOVE” to deactivate an expert, who is then listed as available in the rightmost column. Click “ACT” to send them back to work. Accessible via the “Experts” button in a concrete BS window. 
Production Line commands

__PROD__  
_Mandatory parameter: base ID_  
Shows the Production Lines in a specific base. Accessible via the “Production” button in a concrete BS window. Each Production Line may consist of one or more buildings of the same type.

__PRODQ__  
_Mandatory parameter: Production Line ID_  
Allows you to cancel queued orders, but not the ones that are already being processed. The Efficiency value is influenced by multiple factors including your workers’ satisfaction, the bonus provided by Experts and, in some cases, the planet’s soil fertility. Accessible via the “Details” button in a PROD window.

__PRODCO__  
_Mandatory parameter: Production Line ID_  
Allows you to place a new Production order. Select a Primary Output from the dropdown menu, set an order size and queue your order. If your order requires input materials (as shown at the bottom), make sure they are available first. Accessible via the “New Order” button in a PROD window.

__HQ__  
_No possible parameter_

## Contract commands

__CONT__  
_Mandatory parameter: contract ID_  
This command allows you to view a specific contract. It must be followed up with a long and complex parameter identifying the contract, which is why it is generally recommended to use “CONTS” command and then clicking the desired contract(s).

__CONTS__  
_No possible parameter_  
Displays a list of all your contracts from Commodity Exchanges and Local Markets. Click any contract to open its CONT buffer. Note that you can also view Pending Contracts by selecting them from the list in the right sidebar. (If you can’t see the sidebar, toggle it on using the SDBR button on the left.)

__CONTD__
_Optional parameter: contract ID_
Displays a list of all your contract drafts. Specifying a contract id, or clicking on any draft, will open the draft detail view, where the draft can be edited and sent out.

## Commodity Exchange commands
These following commands all pertain to Commodity Exchanges. The first two are probably the most useful. See all these commands in action in the “Getting Started” tutorial.

__CXOS__  
_No possible parameter_  
Shows a history of your Sell and Buy orders, which you can view and delete from here. By deleting an order that hasn’t been filled yet, or at least not completely, you withdraw it from the market.

__CXO__  
_Mandatory parameter: Contract ID_  
Shows information on an order you made in the past. Accessible via the “VIEW” buttons in the CXOS window.

__CXL__  
_No possible parameter_  
Lists all existing Commodity Exchanges. From here, you can quickly access a concrete Commodity Exchange without having to remember its particular parameter for the CX command.

__CXM__  
_Mandatory parameter: material ticker_  
_Optional parameter: planet ID_  
Compares commodity exchange information for the specified material across _all_ commodity exchanges. Exchanges will be sorted by their distance to the given planet (if one was entered).

__CX__  
_Mandatory parameter: Commodity Exchange ID_  
This is where you can buy and sell items from a particular market. Select the commodity category from the dropdown menu. Accessible for example by clicking the name of a commodity exchange in the CXL window.

__MAT__  
_Mandatory parameter: material ID_  
Materials and commodities are essentially the same thing. Their ticker is the two- or three-letter identifier you can see in each of their little icons. For example, the ticker for Steel is STL. “Wrought product” indicates what can be made from this material and in which Production Line, while “Production” shows you how and where the material itself can be produced. Accessible for example by clicking a commodity’s icon in the CX window.

__CXP, CXPC, CXOB, CXPO__  
_Mandatory parameter: commodity ID + ComEx ID_  
These four commands relate to concrete commodities on a concrete market. Next to an entry of a commodity in the CX window, you’ll find the buttons labeled “INFO”, “CHART”, “ORDERS”, and “TRADE”.
“INFO”: CXP, which shows an overview over current bids, ask amounts, all-time highs and lows etc.
“CHART”: CXPC. Shows a candlestick chart of a commodity’s price over time. If it says “No data”, the commodity hasn’t been sold in the indicated time period. Select a longer time window to fix it.
“ORDERS”: CXOB command, where you can see pending requests and offers.
“TRADE”: CXPO, which lets you place Buy and Sell Orders within the current Price Band. The latter is determined by a three-day average and is wider for PRO licensees than FREE licensees. To quickly set the current lowest bid or asking price, use the “set” buttons in the “Ask / Bid” line. The “Inventory” line lets you select the storage location from which to sell your commodities.

## Space flight commands
It is recommended you use the FLT command and access the other commands from there. To see all these commands in action, have a look at the space-flight tutorial.

__FLT__  
_Optional parameter: system ID / planet ID_  
Entered by itself, the Fleet command shows all of your ships. Every line shows data on one of your ships, like its transponder code, name, status, fill status, location, and information about an ongoing flight. Following up the fleet command with the ID of a system or planet shows all of your ships currently stationed there. (The ID is simply the parameter you can see at the top of a buffer by selecting a system in the Universe Map or a planet in a system map.)

__SHP__  
_Mandatory parameter: ship transponder code_  
Shows information on one of your ships. Rename your ship by clicking its current name (or “unnamed”) and entering a new one.

MU POL: Shows a political map. This is not yet available.

__MS__  
_Mandatory parameter: system ID_  
Like on the Universe Map, yellow arrows mark your ships. Turn on “traffic” to also see the location of other users’ ships, which are marked by white arrows. The wireframe structure in the middle is the system’s star; the circles orbiting it are either rocky (white) or gaseous (orange) planets. White square represent space stations. Hovering over a planet or space station shows its ID. Instead of manually entering the system ID, you may click on the desired system in the Universe map.

__SYSI__
_Optional parameter: system ID_
All systems, named or unnamed, have and ID which consists of the sector ID (two letters) and the system number. The system information commands shows basic information about the system, like its name, star type, micrometeoroid density and faction affinity. It has a list of all planets and stations in that system.
If no system ID is provided a search box is being displayed instead of the system data which allows to search for systems.

__PLI__

All planets, named or unnamed, have an ID, which is the system’s ID followed by a unique letter. Planet Info contains shortcuts to your Fleet and Inventory on that planet. Among other things, you can see here which Resources can be extracted from this planet and its atmosphere, and whether or not the planet lends itself to growing plants. The bar indicating the latter starts in the middle, and the further it extends to the left or right, the more infertile or fertile the planet is respectively. Finally, the Type and Temperature indicate whether you are going to need [additional Construction Materials](../building-costs) to set up a base on this planet.
Each non-grey plot on a planet can be clicked to obtain more information about it. The following colors exist as of yet: blue (other companies), dark blue (other Corp.'s project), yellow (own company), dark yellow (own Corp.'s project), green (CoGC), red (commodity exchange)
Instead of entering the planet ID by hand, you may also click the planet directly in the System map to access its PLI window.
