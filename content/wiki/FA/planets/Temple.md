# The Temple Planet

The Temple planet is a remote gas giant planet used by the devs for debugging. As a sandbox planet for debugging, it had some unusual properties, most famously a fertile gas giant.

The planet was the target for industrial giants in the universe to take up the challenge of establishing a base on this remote, harsh planet. It was rumored that several new players were tricked into bringing supplies out to this planet on a trip where they would run out of fuel and be sacrified to appease the developer molp. It's said the planet is fertile because the remains of past sacrifices are floating in the planet's atmosphere and allow plants to grow. EatTacos88 established a taco plant near the end of the universe, and sold the 100 or so tacos produced in a charity auction event to raise 14 million in various currencies.
