This page lists information on various topics that can neither be covered by the tutorial series nor other wiki pages.

## Troubleshooting FAQ

The official FAQ can be found in [this forum thread](https://com.prosperousuniverse.com/t/frequently-asked-questions/). They cover known bugs and common issues related to player accounts.

## PRO license vs. FREE license

Some features of APEX are only (fully) accessible to PRO users. A PRO license can be acquired [here](https://prosperousuniverse.com/premium).

Note that if you paid for a PRO license _once_, you will keep certain advantages forever as your license will go back to BASIC status instead of FREE.

You can find more information about what the licenses entail in the [license section](../../wiki/pro-license) of the handbook.

- **Escape** closes the currently selected buffer.  

## APEX chat commands

The APEX chat has a number of special functions.  
- **Linking companies**: Preceding any company code with the dollar sign `$` will make it clickable in the chat window and link to the company profile.  
- **Linking licensees**: Preceding any person's name with the `@` sign will make it clickable in the chat window and link to the licensee's profile.
-  **Linking commodity price information**: Posting a commodity's ticker together with a commodity exchange code (for example `HE3.CI1`) will display the current price information for that commodity.
