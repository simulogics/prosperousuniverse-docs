This page will help you find a suitable combination of package, faction and starting location when first establishing your company. Following the advice below is especially vital if you are new to APEX. You best settle on a package first and then have a look at the different factions and the planets they control. Certain planets are better suited for some professions than others, and some planets and professions do not work together at all! But of course, the better suited a planet is for your industry, the higher the local competition will be.

__Please note:__
- Some recommended starter planets do not have a commodity exchange. These are not recommended if you are using APEX for the first time.
- When setting up your base, two additional Pioneer Habitation modules are recommended regardless of package.

## Packages

### Victualler
__Short description__
Producing agricultural products that can be used in the food industries is the foundation of every colony.

__Long description__
Victuallers are the heart of the food industry. Their profession revolves around extracting water, producing ingredients and turning it all into edibles for their own and others' workforces. Without victuallers, all other industries would soon come to a halt, which is why their trade will always be relevant across the universe.

#### Important notes
As a victualler, you will depend on water. If you do not settle on a planet with water, you will have a hard time turning a profit. The speed at which the crops on your farms will grow depends on a planet's soil fertility - the higher the fertility, the quicker the growth.

#### Recommended starter buildings
__Rig (RIG):__ Extracts liquids (water) from the ground.
__Farmstead (FRM):__ Requires water to output different integredients used in food production and adjacent industries.
__Food Processor (FP):__ Takes food ingredients and turns them into consumables.

#### Recommended starter planet
Promitor (Insitor Cooperative)
Proxion (Castillo-Ito Mercantile)

#### Starting Experts
2 Food Industries experts


### Metallurgist
__Short description__
Metallurgists have all the knowledge and tools necessary to extract minerals and refine them into precious metals and composites.

__Long description__
If you don't mind getting your (workers') hands dirty, this might be the job for you. Operating at the base of several industry branches, metallurgists produce ores, smelt them down and supply their trade partners with refined metals that will ultimately go into the construction of buildings, ships, and other structures.

#### Important notes
Extracting ores from the ground will be an essential everyday task for your company. Make sure that your planet contains at least one mineral, or you will not be able to put your Extractor to use. Plus, if that mineral is not an ore, you cannot put it into your smelter.

#### Recommended starter buildings
__Extractor (EXT):__ Extracts ores from a planet's surface.
__Smelter (SME):__ Refines ores into metals.

#### Recommended starter planet
Vallis (NEO Charter Exploration)

#### Starting Experts
2 Metallurgy Experts


### Carbon Farmer
__Short description__
Carbon farmers grow plants and extract carbon from them.

__Long description__
Carbon has become a vital resource across different industries, so much so that a whole job profile has evolved around it: the carbon farmer. Even though you will be planting crops like a victualler, you will not have much to do with the food industry. Instead, your plants will be harvested for their precious carbon, which is the basis for many essential production processes in the metal and other industries.

#### Important notes
Setting up shop on a planet with higher fertility will help increase your farms' output. If a planet is completely infertile, farms cannot be built at all, leaving your company dead in the water!

#### Recommended starter buildings
__Farmstead (FRM) (2x):__ Requires water to output different integredients used in food production and adjacent industries.
__Incinerator (INC):__ Extracts pure carbon from different carbon-rich plants.

#### Recommended starter planets
Promitor (Insitor Cooperative)

#### Starting Experts
2 Agriculture Experts


### Manufacturer
__Short description__
Manufacturers produce construction granulate, tools and plastics for their trade partners to process further.

__Long description__
As a manufacturer, you will be a versatile creature which does not depend too much on a single industry. Your company's main purpose will be to supply your trade partners with goods such as basic clothing and building parts. Getting started as a manufacturer is quite complex logistically, as you will have to buy your input materials from a nearby commodity exchange.

#### Important notes
Your production lines will need hydrogen and carbon to operate. Hydrogen can be extracted from the atmosphere of certain planets directly, but initially you should look into buying it from a commodity exchange. Carbon is produced by an incinerator from various agricultural goods that will also be available on the market.

#### Recommended starter buildings
__Basic Materials Plant (BMP) (2x):__ Produces a host of materials and end products needed to bootstrap a colony.

#### Recommended starter planets
Vallis (NEO Charter Exploration)
Gibson (Castillo-Ito Mercantile)

#### Starting Experts
2 Manufacturing Experts


### Constructor
__Short description__
Constructors know their way around building parts, from basic structural elements to complex engineering materials.

__Long description__
You and your fellow constructors will be the key element to expanding existing bases or establishing new ones. Your output materials, mostly polyethylene and different building parts, will go toward the construction of your and your clients' buildings.

#### Important notes
Since you will not be extracting or mining yourself, your production will require purchasing a host of natural resources, such as Iron, Limestone, Carbon, and Hydrogen.

#### Recommended starter buildings
__Basic Materials Plant (BMP):__ Produces a host of materials and end products needed to bootstrap a colony.  
__Prefab Plant Mk1 (PP1):__ Produces basic prefabs necessary to construct buildings.

#### Recommended starter planets
Montem (NEO Charter Exploration)
Vallis (NEO Charter Exploration)
Gibson (Castillo-Ito Mercantile)

#### Starting Experts
2 Construction Experts


### Fuel Engineer
__Short description__
Fuel engineers extract resources and synthesize them to different types of fuels.

__Long description__
The commodities you produce will be the foundation of faster-than-light and slower-than-light space travel. Both fuel types are based on a variety of gaseous and solid ingredients, so there is plenty of room for development and specialization in your trade.

#### Important notes
Your Extractor will only be useful in STL fuel production if there is Galerite on your planet. You could instead opt for a Collector and settle on a planet prodiving Ammonia or Hydrogen.

#### Recommended starter buildings
__Refinery (REF):__ Produces fuels used for space flight.
_Instead of Collector:_ __Extractor (EXT):__ Extracts ores and minerals from the surface.
_Instead of Extractor:_ __Collector (COL):__  Extracts gases from the atmosphere.

#### Recommended starter planets
_With Extractor:_ Katoa (Castillo-Ito Mercantile)
_With Collector:_ Katoa (Castillo-Ito Mercantile)

#### Starting Experts
2 Fuel Refining Experts


## Factions

__When picking your faction and planet, make sure they work well with your desired starter package.__
