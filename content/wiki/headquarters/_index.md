## General information

One of your bases always serves as your company headquarters. You can check on its current status via the **HQ command**.

### HQ upgrades

You can upgrade your HQ if you have the required materials in the base's storage.

Upgrading your HQ grants you one of two things:
* Most levels grant you an additional **base permit** (beyond the 2 you start with), so you can found more bases.
* Levels 5, 10, 13, 16, 18 and 20 grant you additional **queue slots** to make managing your production queues easier.

Each upgrade is more expensive than the one before. Starting from level 6, upgrading your HQ is only possible with an active [PRO license](../../wiki/pro-license).

### Faction bonuses

Depending on the faction of your HQ's location (find it in the **PLI** command of the planet your HQ is located on), it will grant you a bonus on your production efficiency in certain industries:
* **Antares Initiative:** 5% bonus on electronics
* **Castillo-Ito Mercantile:** 5% bonus on manufacturing
* **Insitor Cooperative:** 3% bonus on agriculture, 2% on food industries
* **NEO Charter Exploration:** 2% bonus on metallurgy, 3% on construction
* **No faction:** 2% bonus on chemistry, fuel refining and resource extraction

You can relocate your HQ to another one of your bases every 30 days. It will keep its current level.
