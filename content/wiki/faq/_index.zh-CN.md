## 通用

### 游戏目前处于什么状态？

Prosperous Universe is currently in Early Access. The goals of Early Access are to build a community early, integrate player feedback and help fund the game's development until the full release.

### 在抢先体验之后会发生什么？

The next big steps will be ultimately preparing the game for the full launch (TBA). The single game world will be reset multiple times during Early Access and finally become persistent upon full launch.

### Prosperous Universe 是免费游戏吗？

The game can be played for free! However, licensees playing for free have to deal with a few restrictions on what their companies can do. Upgrading to PRO is possible at any time by selecting a subscription plan (starting at 8€). Support tier packages are also available that give players in-game perks and PrUn merchandise. This crowdfunding-like system allows early adopters to help fund development and get some great perks in return.

### 为什么今天还要制作基于浏览器的游戏？

We think that the browser is a very capable gaming platform, available on pretty much every computer and every system in the world. It's the perfect match for the kind of play style we have in mind, allowing people to play from their office or while doing something else without having to download, install and run client software.

### Prosperous Universe 可以在移动设备上玩吗？

Yes, a mobile version of Prosperous Universe has been released. Just open the game's URL on a mobile browser to access it.

### 游戏会在 Steam / Apple App Store / 我喜欢的平台上架吗？

First and foremost, Prosperous Universe is a browser-based game. We have released it on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1761220/Prosperous_Universe/) as well, supporting Windows and Linux at the moment, other platforms like Apple App Store are a low priority for us right now though.

### 我可以更改我的用户名吗？

Unfortunately not. However, you can change your company name using COLIQ.

### 这个宇宙什么时候会重置？

Currently, there are no set dates for when this universe will reset. The current universe started on February 23, 2021. The universe for First Access (previous universe) lasted approximately 2 years.

### PRO/BASIC/FREE许可有何区别？

You can find in-depth information [here](../pro-license).

### 这款游戏是付费即赢（P2W）吗？

No. While there are restrictions in place when you don't have PRO or Basic, there are only _cosmetic_ benefits to purchasing higher support tiers. For example, purchasing the universe support tier gains you no gameplay advantage of that of someone that simply purchases a month of PRO.

### PRO许可是自动续订的吗？

No. There are no recurring payments.

### 我付款后需要多久才能升级为PRO？

Under normal circumstances, it should occur immediately. If even after a refresh the game doesn’t reflect your PRO status, please contact a developer in discord or send an email to hello at prosperousuniverse dot com.

### 如何获得支持者福利，例如昵称特别颜色和频道权限？

You should receive in-game benefits immediately. For Discord colors & channel access, DM a Developer in discord or send an email to hello at prosperousuniverse dot com with your Discord name & id (usually of the format **DiscordName#1234**).

### 如果宇宙已经发展这么久了，我会不会落后太远？

While you will be smaller than more mature companies initially, there is **always** an economic need for the products the starter packages lead to you producing.


## 游戏玩法

### 我忘了自己选了哪个入门包，怎样查找？

The **HELP** command contains a section labeled "Building Recommendations" which displays your starter package.

### 我该如何重新开始？

The **COLIQ** command.

1. Click **NEW BFR** in the bottom-left corner of APEX.
2. Type **COLIQ** into the newly spawned buffer and hit enter.
3. Follow the instructions.
4. Refresh the browser tab containing APEX.

### 我可以多久进行一次 COLIQ？

The cooldown timers for COLIQ are:
- First: 0 days
- Second: 3 days
- Third: 21 days
- Subsequent: 60 days

### 我要离开游戏一段时间。不活跃账号会如何处理？

We don’t delete inactive accounts, but the company associated with an inactive account.

- Companies from PRO accounts will not be liquidated at all
- Companies from BASIC accounts will be notified after 180 days of inactivity and liquidated 31 days afterward
- Companies from accounts less than 7 days old will be notified after 6 days of inactivity and liquidated 5 days afterward
- Companies less than 21 days old will be notified after 21 days of inactivity and liquidated 7 days afterward
- Companies more than 21 days old will be notified after 72 days of inactivity and liquidated 21 days afterward

Logging in will reset the timers from above.

### 我不小心删除了一些面板。可以重置为默认界面吗？

Not currently. That being said, you should become familiar with the APEX interface and modify it to fit your needs as _any_ buffer can be made into a tile.

### 大家经常用很多缩略词。我怎样才能弄清他们在说什么？

Open either a **MAT** (material) or **BUI** (building) buffer to the acronym.

- **MAT XXX**
- **BUI YYY**

Other acronyms:
- MM - Market Maker, an infinite buy/sell for certain materials on all CX (Commodity Exchanges)
- LM - [Local Market](../../tutorials/legacy-tutorials/planetary-projects/#local-markets)
- COGC - [Chamber of Global Commerce](../../tutorials/legacy-tutorials/planetary-projects/#chamber-of-global-commerce-cogc)
- POPI - [Population Infrastructure](../../tutorials/legacy-tutorials/planetary-population/)
- For all others, check the [Command List](../commands-list/) page

### 有没有办法私下交易商品？

Yes, PRO users can create custom contracts using the **CONTD** command and send them to other players. Closing contracts requires a PRO or BASIC license.

### 我该如何与我的朋友合作？

The simplest way is to organize favorable LM (Local Market) ads. For example:

- PlayerA exclusively produces H2O (water).
- PlayerB exclusively runs FPs (Food Processors) solely producing DW (Drinking Water).
- PlayerB purchases H2O from PlayerA and produces DW to sell on the CX.

### 我如何查看自己有多少钱？

- The **FINLA** command
- Enable **SDBR** top-left to show your cash balances on the right side

### 为什么我不能使用 LM（本地市场）、FX（外汇兑换），或竞选管理者？

A [PRO](../pro-license) license is required.

### 为什么游戏提示我不允许为某个候选人投票？

You need to be a resident of the planet for 48 hours before you can cast a vote.

### 我在哪里可以找到要加入的集团？

- Ask around in APEX chat, [Official Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rRbqqRz), or the [forums](https://com.prosperousuniverse.com)
- Join [UFO Discord](https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP) and follow the instructions to join the recruitment channels

### 我有一个行星名称。怎样才能查到它在哪里？

The **PLI** command by itself (without any arguments). Once done, you can type in the name of the planet.

### 我应该从哪个行星开始？现在有什么合适的新手包？

As with most things in this game, it depends. There is not a single correct answer. Many in the community are willing to share their opinions on the matter, however, so don't hesitate to ask in-game, on the official [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rRbqqRz), or on the [forums](https://com.prosperousuniverse.com).

### “强盗行为”是什么？

Pirating is when a player places or picks up an ad and _intentionally_ does not hold up their end of the contract. This takes the following forms:

+ For buy/sell ads:
   - The company paying doesn't fulfill their end of the contract (paying)
   - The company putting forth material goods doesn't fulfill their end of the contract
+ For shipping ads:
   - The company requesting the shipping being done doesn't pay
   - The company doing the shipping fails to deliver, leading to the contents of the shipment being unpacked into their inventory

Failing to fulfill a contract negatively impacts your reliability rating in game.

### 我有一座建筑，按理现在应该已经产出一名专家了。为什么我还没有收到？

There a few things to note when it comes to experts:

- Expert-days are only accumulated at the end of a production order
- Expert-days assume 100% order efficiency
- Expert-days reset after each expert. In total, it takes 21.5 days to go from 0 to 2 experts.

### 建筑损耗是什么意思？其影响是什么？

Over time, buildings degrade and in turn, production line efficiency for that building goes down.

### 我什么时候需要修理我的建筑？

As with many things in this game, it depends. Many in the community suggest repairing at around 90 days.

### 土地肥沃度如何影响我的建筑？

- Fertility allows the construction of FRMs (Farms) and ORCs (Orchards)
- Fertility has a maximum impact of roughly -33% to +33%

### "某个肥力"是好的吗？

As with most things in Prosperous Universe, it depends on the scenario in question. It's worth noting that since fertility has a maximum range of roughly -33% to +33%, fertility isn't quite as impactful as H2O (water) concentration.

### 外汇（货币兑换）是如何运作的？

Read the [FX Tutorial](../../tutorials/legacy-tutorials/foreign-exchange/)

### 我尝试交付一批货物，但显示“已尝试交付”。我该怎么办？

This message means that the user in question doesn’t have sufficient storage space (weight or volume) to store the shipment. Contact the user to let them know.

### 如果你不支付仓库费用会发生什么？

Your warehouse is locked and you can’t use it or access any materials contained within it. If you fail to pay for multiple weeks, you will need to pay each missing week before it unlocks.

### 游戏内有便签本可以使用吗？

Not *specifically* a notepad. However, you can make a new chat group just for yourself and type in there.
- Click **COM**
- Click **NEW GROUP**
- Type "Notepad"
- Click **CREATE**
- Dock the buffer as a tile

Doing this has the added benefit of allowing you to type tickers in the chat and viewing the up-to-date price for those tickers.

### 如何在聊天中创建特殊的标签链接？

Simply type the ticker.  For example: `RAT.IC1`

### 我如何在地图上找到一颗行星？
- Have **MU NAV** visible (click the **MAP** button)
- Hover over a link to the planet to see the pulsating radial around the system

To find a link to a planet by name:
- Click **NEW BFR**
- Type **PLI** and hit enter
- Type in the name of the planet and click it
- Click the **SYSI** (System Information) button at the top of the newly created **PLI** buffer
- Mouse over the planet link

### 如何测试到某处需要多少燃料以及需要多长时间？
- Click **NEW BFR**
- Type **BLU** and hit enter
- Click **CREATE NEW**
- The standard blueprint preset is your starter ship
- Click **TEST** next to the **VIEW** button
- Click **BTF** button in the upper-right (Blueprint Flight Simulator)
- Add a Origin, Destination, and modify settings as necessary.

## 基地

### 好吧，我的生产线将在接下来的 24 小时内运行。现在干什么？

Prosperous Universe is intentionally a slow-paced, real-time game. In the meantime, however, you can:
- Gain familiarity with the game and its production
- Chat with others in-game, on the [Official Discord](https://discord.com/invite/rRbqqRz), and [UFO Discord](https://discord.gg/vwcUJx8HHP)
- You can do some future planning (making spreadsheets)
- You can do some market research and see if trading between CXs (Commodity Exchanges) would net you profit
- You can look at Local Markets and the CX Shipping market to see if anything is worthwhile for you to do (requires Basic)

### 为什么我的生产线显示为已停止？

Possible causes:
- There is no capacity (habitation buildings) for your workers
- There are no consumables for your workers available in the base storage
- There are no inputs available for the recipe
- You don’t have sufficient funds for production taxes
- There are no workers of that tier available from the [workforce reserve pool](../../tutorials/legacy-tutorials/planetary-population/#worker-redistribution)

### 我怎样才能找出哪些行星拥有我正在寻找的资源？

Use some of the great [community tools](../community-resources/#tools):
- [FIO PlanetSearch](https://fio.fnar.net/planetsearch)
- [Yapt PlanetSearch](https://aeryen23.github.io/yapt/#/planetsearch)
- [Prosperity](https://prosperity-prun.netlify.app/)

### 我的劳动力显示为类似 180（40）。括号内的数字是什么意思？

The number of workforce that were pulled from the [workforce reserve pool](../../tutorials/legacy-tutorials/planetary-population/index.html#worker-redistribution).

### 如何取消我在本地市场（LM）发布的广告？

Use the **LMOS** command to delete the ad.

### 我不小心接手了一个本地市场（LM）广告，并非有意为之。我应该怎么办？

You should contact the player which placed the ad and let them know of the situation. If neither party fulfills any portion of the contract, the contract will be canceled with both parties being unaffected rating-wise.

### 在行星上不同颜色的地块代表什么？

You can click on the plots yourself to inspect them.

- Grey: Unused plot
- Blue: Used plot
- Yellow: Your plot
- Red: Administration Center
- Dark Red: Population Infrastructure
- Green: Chamber of Global Commerce
- Pink: Local Market

### 如果我的工人消耗品耗尽会怎样？

Production halts. While production is halted, buildings continue to degrade, so it's usually in your best interest to keep workforces fed.

### 我应该使用像 PWO 和 COF 这样的奢侈消耗品吗？

As with many aspects of Prosperous Universe, it depends. You may need to check prices and determine if they’re worthwhile. Assuming basic consumables are present:

- PWO alone provides ~87% efficiency @ 0.2 used daily/100 pioneers
- COF alone provides ~91% efficiency @ 0.5 used daily/100 pioneers

_Generally_, PWO tends to be always worthwhile while COF requires a deeper analysis.

### 如果我的混合劳动力层级建筑只有一个劳动力层级，会发生什么？

The effect of available workforce on the production line efficiency is directly proportional to the number of workers present, it is not weighted by workforce tier.

For example, if you have a building that requires 20 settlers and 30 technicians but you have 20 settlers and 0 technicians, that production line will have a `20 / (20+30)` (or 0.4 / 40%) efficiency multiplier from the workforce.

### 如果我没钱了会怎么样？

- Your production lines halt. While halted, buildings continue to degrade.
- Warehouses will be locked if the fee is due and items will be unavailable.

### 如何提高我的公司评级？

In order to not be **Unrated (U)**, your account must be Basic or PRO.

In order to not be **Pending (P)**:
- Your company must be a few weeks old
- You must fulfill some Local Market/Shipment ads

### 公司评分是如何确定的？

The rating considers the value of contracts you fulfilled versus the value of contracts you breached. High-value contracts are generally more impactful, but there is always a mix of the most valuable and the most recent contracts being considered, so that the company rating is as accurate a representation of a company's reliability as possible.

### 我建造了一个钻井（RIG），但无法采集水（H2O）。为什么？

Before building a RIG, EXT, or COL it is important to check the PLI (Planet Info) command for the planet to ensure the resource is present. Depending on planetary conditions (temperature, gravity, and pressure), resources can require different buildings to extract said resource.

- Gaseous resources require a COL
- Liquid resources require a RIG
- Minerals & ores require a EXT

Do note that many resources can be in any of the three states and the building required to extract the material may vary.

### 循环订单如何运作？

Recurring orders is a [PRO](https://handbook.apex.prosperousuniverse.com/wiki/pro-license/) feature. When a recurring order moves from the pending queue to the active queue, the same order is re-added to the *bottom* of the pending queue. In this way, the recurring order system allows you to cycle through recipes repeatedly.

### 总部等级最多可以升级多少次？

- With a FREE/BASIC account, you can upgrade up to HQ level 5.
- With a PRO account, you can upgrade an infinite amount of times. The costs of HQ upgrades does go up, however.

If your account degrades from PRO to Basic, you maintain your existing HQ level but can’t upgrade until you have PRO again.

### 有没有办法知道未来达到某个总部等级的建造费用？

In-game, you can only see the next level's costs. However, members of the community have tracked the [HQ level costs](https://pct.fnar.net/hq/).

### 拆除一座建筑会回收哪些零件？

You will get a percentage of the parts depending on how long it has been since you last repaired. If you demolish the building within one hour of building it, you will receive all parts back.  To view the parts you will receive:
- Click **BS**
- Click **VIEW BASE**
- Click **BUILDINGS**
- Find the building you’re considering demolishing
- Materials listed under **Reclaimable materials** are the parts you will get back

### 我如何计算我的劳动力效率？

Workforce calculations sometimes change and aren't directly exposed in the game.  However, members of the community have calculated the [efficiency formulas](https://pct.fnar.net/workforce/).

### 我如何修理我的飞船？

- Click your ship's transponder link or name link in the **FLT** tile/buffer.
- Acquire the **Repair costs** materials and place them into a planet's **Base inventory**.
- Fly your ship to that planet
- Click your ship's transponder link or name link and click **REPAIR**

### 括号中显示在行星地块旁的数字是什么意思？

The **(+###)** is the number of "ghost plots" or the number of plots taken that is over the capacity of the planet. For your first base, you’re permitted to start on any planet (including full planets).  If the planet is at capacity, the number of ghost plots increases. This allows new players to be able to settle any initial planet without hindrance.

Do note that for any subsequent base, you’re unable to settle planets that are capacity. If a regular plot player is reaped (due to inactivity), the first ghost plot takes its place.

### 当合同被“closed”是什么意思？

The word **close** or **closed** has a legal meaning of "both parties agree to the contract and it is unchangeable." Effectively, it means both parties accept the terms.

### 为什么我要加大订单规模？

When starting out, you generally never want to multiply orders. However, after some time, you will end up multiplying orders to:

- Stagger production outputs
- Maintain output ratios (a very common use-case is FRM outputs for RAT)
- Reduce how frequently you need to interact with a production line

The major reason you don't want to multiply orders in the early game is because expert accumulation is done at the completion of an order.  So if you’re 6 hours away from your next expert, but you queue up a 20x order which takes 48 hours, you won't gain the benefit of the additional expert for that order.


## 商品市场

### 我如何获得另一种货币？

- Load up goods into a ship, fly to another CX, and sell the goods at the foreign CX for the currency
- Use the FX (Foreign Exchange) to purchase another currency (requires PRO)
- List a LM (Local Market) ad to sell materials for another currency (requires PRO)
- Accept a Buy ad on a LM (Local Market) for another currency (requires Basic)
- Fulfill a shipping contract for another currency (requires Basic)

### 我在飞往商品市场 (CX) 的航行上应该消耗多少燃料？

As with many aspects of Prosperous Universe, it depends on your scenario. Many in the community, however, suggest when starting that you:
- Set **Reactor Usage** (FTL Drive) to minimum
- Set **Fuel Usage** (STL Drive) to a few ticks above minimum and modify the slider until it makes sense
- Ensure you’re available (i.e. not asleep) when the ship lands

### 我在 CX（商品市场）买了东西但找不到了。它到哪里去了？

+ Ensure you _actually_ purchased it
   - Bring up a **CXOB** buffer to the material.  Example: `CXOB RAT.IC1`
   - See if your company name is present in the Requests list.  If so, you merely have a bid for goods and need to either:
      - Wait for somebody to be willing to sell at the your price
      - Take down your existing order using the **CXOS** command and place another one for the lowest asking price
+ If you rented a warehouse on the station, it will be in the warehouse storage
+ If you have a ship attached to the station, it will be in the ship storage
+ Otherwise, the CX will create a contract for you to pick it up.  You can use the **CONTS** command or click **SDBR** in the upper-left to show pending contracts.

### 我如何/在哪里领取我刚买的货物？

You need to fly to the CX (Commodity Exchange) and retrieve the items.

### 我想在 CX（商品市场）上出售东西，但无法选择存储位置。该怎么办？

The CX is a space station in a separate orbit from planets. You’re required to transport goods to the station.

In order to sell items on the CX, you need to ensure that those items are available in a storage on the CX. Storage is defined as:
- A ship attached to the station
- A warehouse on the station

### 如何在商品市场（CX）上取消订单？

Use the **CXOS** command to delete the order.

### 如何阅读 CX 图表（CXPC）？

The CX charts (CXPC command) are **Candlestick Charts**. You can modify the timeframe in the upper-left and the transaction grouping timeframe in the upper-right. As you move your mouse over horizontally, values in the upper-left will change relative to where you’re hovering:
- **O** - Open price - The price at the start of the timeframe
- **H** - High price - The highest price of the timeframe
- **L** - Low price - The lowest price of the timeframe
- **C** - Close price - The price at the end of the timeframe
- **Vol** - Volume - The total units sold times the price.
- **SMA** - Simple Moving Average - The average price (blue line).

The number of units sold is represented by the bars at the bottom.

## 错误报告

### 我的地图缺少大量信息，而且 APEX 非常慢。为什么？

The APEX map uses a renderer which leverages **Hardware Acceleration**. If disabled for your browser, it will either fail to function properly or fall-back on the much slower, more CPU intensive software renderer.

### 我在界面中看到大量**Hydration Timeout**错误。我应该怎么办？

Hydration Timeouts happen when the game client doesn't receive data of the individual game entities in a certain time-frame (the request times out). In general, there are two major causes:
- APEX servers are slower than usual and not responding in time. This can happen if one of the servers is rebooting for example.
- A game entity is running into an error and can’t respond to the request

The vast majority of the time, simply refreshing the browser after waiting for a moment fixes the issue. In some scenarios, the servers (or the ISP hosting the servers) could be the cause--in which case, it may be worthwhile to ask in discord if any others are seeing similar issues.

### 我遇到一个错误。我要在哪里报告？
